#1. Use the dataset mpg


#a. Show your solutions on how to import a csv file into the environment.

#b. Which variables from mpg dataset are categorical?

#the variables from mpg dataset that are categorical are manufacturer, model,transmission, drv, fl, class.

#c. Which are continuous variables?
#the continuous variables are displ, year, cyl, cty, hwy.

#2. Which manufacturer has the most models in this data set? Which model has the most variations?
# Show your answer.

#b. For you, is it useful? If not, how could you modify the data to make it more informative?

#No, it is not useful because the scatter plot is too cluttered and the data points are overlapping. To make it more informative, we can group the data by manufacturer and model and then plot the count of each combination.

#3. Plot the model and the year using ggplot(). Use only the top 20 observations. Write the codes and its results.
