# 4. interpret the graph 
# The graph shows the sentiment of tweets collected on different days. 
# The sentiment is classified into three categories: 
# the positive represented by Blue, the negative represented by Red, 
# and the neutral represented by Yellow. 
# The data is shown from July 14, 2020, to July 20, 2020. 
# The Y-axis represents the count of tweets, while the X-axis 
# shows the different sentiment categories for each day. 
# On almost every day, the Red or Negative sentiment is the highest, 
# followed by the Blue or Positive sentiment, and the Yellow 
# or Neutral sentiment is the lowest. 
# The highest count of tweets is on July 15, 2020, 
# while the lowest count of tweets is on July 20, 2020. 
# The sentiment of the tweets is mostly negative, followed by positive, 
# and the least is neutral.
